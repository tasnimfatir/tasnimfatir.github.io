It was in August, 2016 when I travelled to Sunamganj with my cousins. Though I don’t remember the name of that place, these photos were captured there during the sunset.  Probably this was somewhere in Barektila or Tekerghat. After a lot of burgeoning and pleading (because it was getting really late and nobody wanted to sail their boats), we managed to get on a boat to reach Tahirpur where we were staying during the trip. Right before the boatman started the engine as we were sitting on the boat in a peaceful and calm atmosphere, I was able to take the photographs. Although, these were not incredible shots; however, the ethereal feelings remained with these photographs due to the sky and peacefulness. I have seen different kinds of colors in the sky, but a sky with a setting sun is incredible.

After the sun set, it became really dark; before we could realize, a storm occurred. We were still in the middle of that Haor ( with no land nearby, or we were not able to see any. On that boat, there were seven people on board and only two had any swimming skills; of course, I wasn’t among those two. The boat was rolling a lot because of the wind and waves; then, I literally felt that the boat would capsize anytime and we would die.  After witnessing that calm and beautiful sky of sunset, I didn’t realize I would see a pitch-black dark sky with frightening lightnings. I started doing supplications, and recite some surah because the whole situation was horrific. At that time, probably my mother and my khala (aunt) called us on our phones (mothers have strong instincts) and I don’t remember whether we picked up their calls. It was unbelievably scary. The rain, lightning, waves, wind, water around us and no swimmers - a perfect combination to be scared to death. The boatman wasn’t scared, so we were able to reach our destination safe and sound; however, my cousin got injured when he was helping us to get down from the boat. 

The whole day was memorable right from the beginning when we set out to go here and there. That day, we walked a lot, climbed, ate a lot because we were very hungry. We had bhaat (rice), daal (lentils) and chicken curry in a very cheap road-side tin shed hotel. That whole trip was memorable to me for a lot of reasons. Let’s keep that for later!
